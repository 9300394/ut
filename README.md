Usage : 

	using (var httpServer = new HttpServer(new HttpRequestProvider()))
	{
		// Normal port 80 :
		httpServer.Use(new TcpListenerAdapter(new TcpListener(IPAddress.Loopback, 80)));
        
		// Ssl Support :
		var serverCertificate = X509Certificate.CreateFromCertFile(@"TempCert.cer");
		httpServer.Use(new ListenerSslDecorator(new TcpListenerAdapter(new TcpListener(IPAddress.Loopback, 443)), serverCertificate));

		// Request handling : 
		httpServer.Use((context, next) => {
			Console.WriteLine("Got Request!");
			return next();
		});

		// Handler classes : 
		httpServer.Use(new TimingHandler());
		httpServer.Use(new HttpRouter().With(string.Empty, new IndexHandler())
										.With("about", new AboutHandler()));
		httpServer.Use(new FileHandler());
		httpServer.Use(new ErrorHandler());
		
		httpServer.Start();
		
		Console.ReadLine();
	}
	
## Under Construction

µHttpSharp is going through heavy modifications to be more like [koa](http://koajs.com) :  

* ~~new `IHttpContext` interface (Gathers `IHttpResponse`, `IHttpRequest` and maybe even session)~~ (Done)
* ~~new `httpServer.Use((context, next) => { next(); });` syntax~~ (Done)

More modifications will be made to make it more "user friendly" out of the box :

* ~~[RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) controllers~~ (Done)
* Caching support
* NuGet package
* ~~Ssl Support~~ (Done!)

## Performance

�HttpSharp manages to handle **13000 requests a sec** (With Keep-Alive support) on core i5 machine, cpu goes to 27%, memory consumption and number of threads is stable.
